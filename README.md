## Setup
The Ffau editor is made to be easily addable to any existing project. There are 4 main steps to setting the Ffau up for a simple project like the one linked above.

1. Clone this repo into your project's equivalent of the `assets` directory - any nice, static place will do.

```
git clone https://github.com/codeddraig/ffau.git
```

2. Import our libraries in a specific order. Due to Blockly being our main dependency, you have to import our assets quite specifically. Here's a perfect example (all file paths are relative to the root of this repo):

```html
<head>
    <!-- google's blockly stuff first -->
    <script src="library/blockly/google-blockly/blockly_compressed.js"></script>
    <script src="library/blockly/google-blockly/msg/js/en.js"></script>

    <!-- jquery (you probably already have it imported, but make sure you've got at least v3.2.1) -->
    <script src="library/jquery/jquery-3.2.1.js"></script>

    <!-- our blockly blocks and generators -->
    <script src="library/blockly/html/blocks.js"></script>
    <script src="library/blockly/html/generator.js"></script>

    <!-- ace editor (optional: if you want a syntax-highlighted code preview) -->
    <script src="library/ace/src-noconflict/ace.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>

    <!-- ffau js last -->
    <script src="dist/ffau.js"></script>
</head>

<body>

    <!-- some elements need to go here, see step 3 -->

    <script>
        // Your JS goes at the bottom of <body>
        const ffau = new Ffau();
    </script>
</body>
```

3. Add the toolbox and pick which Ffau components you want to use. We won't explain how the toolbox works in too much detail, but it's simply a bit of XML that defines which blocks should go in your toolbox, and how to arrange them.

**See BLOCKS.md for a full list of XML blocks**

Here's an example using all Ffau components and three blocks:

```html
<body>
    <!-- blockly container, must have fixed height & width -->
    <div id="blockly" style="height: 480px; width: 100%;"></div>

    <!-- iframe container -->
    <div id="frame-preview"></div>

    <!-- ace container, also must have fixed dimensions -->
    <div id="code-preview" style="height: 480px; width: 100%;"></div>

    <!-- style="display: none;" is important! Otherwise, XML would try to render as HTML -->
    <xml id="toolbox" style="display: none;">
        <block type="body"></block> <!-- <body> -->
        <block type="paragraph"></block> <!-- <p> -->
        <block type="emptytext"></block> <!-- empty text to go inside paragraph -->
    </xml>
</body>
```

4. Render all components using ffau.js. If your page is the same as the one shown in step 3, you can put this at the bottom of your body:

```html
<script>
    const ffau = new Ffau();

    // must come first, renders the Blockly interface
    ffau.renderBlockly(
        document.getElementById("blockly"), // container to put blockly in
        document.getElementById("toolbox") // XML toolbox
    );

    // renders iframe preview
    ffau.renderPreview(
        document.getElementById("frame-preview") // container to put iframe in
    );

    // renders the ace editor
    ffau.renderCode(
        ace, // pass the window.ace object to this function, just to make sure it works
        document.getElementById("code-preview") // container to put ace in
    );

    // Now that everything has been rendered, you need to add a change listener to Blockly.
    // This will make the contents of the code and frame previews update whenever Blockly does.
    ffau.addEvent();

    // That's it!
</script>
```

You can find documentation for all functions in the `Ffau` class at https://codeddraig.github.io/ffau/docs/Ffau.html.

## Export
Ffau can save your blocks to a text file in the browser (with the extension '.txt') and import them to re-assemble your blocks. Files exported from Ffau can be imported to CodeDragon (https://codedragon.org), and vice-versa.

## Libraries
This project would not be possible without the following amazing libraries. We are much indebted to them for their support and work:

### jQuery (http://jquery.com/)
The JavaScript library which handles DOM transversals and event handling with far more grace and ease than pure JavaScript. It is also a requirement for other libraries used in this project.

### Blockly by Google (https://github.com/google/blockly)
A magic library which you should have heard of by now. It creates the whole drag-and-drop block system, which is the basis for this entire system!

### Magic.css by Pal Kerecsenyi (https://github.com/palkerecsenyi/magic)
CSS library for everything but the editor itself. Developed by one of our own team!

### Ace Editor (https://ace.c9.io/)
Handles syntax highlighting in the "Real Code" tab.

### Music by Kevin MacLeod (http://incompetech.com)
"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy", "Monkeys Spinning Monkeys", "Pixelland" - (Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/))

### Video by the Open Movie Foundation (http://blender.org)
**Trailer for "Big Buck Bunny"** and **"Llama Drama, Episode 1"**.

## Inspiration
Our project is inspired by, but not a direct clone of, the blockly-html project (https://github.com/bwinf/blockly-html) by the BWNIF (Bundesweit Informatik Nachwuchs FÃ¶rdern), a German organisation which seeks to further development in Computer Science among children. Also, we owe some of our inspiration to the EduBlocks project (https://github.com/AllAboutCode/EduBlocks) by Joshua Lowe, which performs a similar function to our work, but for Python, rather than the web.
