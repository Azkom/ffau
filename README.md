## Libraries
This project would not be possible without the following amazing libraries. We are much indebted to them for their support and work:

### Blockly by Google (https://github.com/google/blockly)
A magic library which you should have heard of by now. It creates the whole drag-and-drop block system, which is the basis for this entire system!

> The lime green coat with piping. She loves the way the coat shines, the contrast of greens, the acid of the lime against the pine-colored braids. Grit under her feet mixed with mud. The wind screaming, leaves scattering against her skin. A puddle. Clouds reflected, dizzy, the silvery light and her face, blurred. Not hard-edged and glass cold, a mirror to talk back like the boys on the street. Who’s got an ugly mug? Boyfriend didn’t like you, eh? She touches the scarred skin. Tree roots and lightning, brilliant. Reflected in the water there is only her own illuminated beauty.
